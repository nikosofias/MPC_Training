## Optimal control via Deep Neural Networks

**_Abstract_** **— Model predictive control is an advanced
method to control the dynamics of a system while
satisfying a certain set of constraints. The method itself is
gaining more and more popularity in all sorts of industries
ranging from chemical plants and oil refineries where they
have been used since the 80s, to power plants, and more
generally power systems.
Deep neural networks are neural networks with more
than one layer. They are considered to be universal
function approximators, which would make them perfectly
suited for data driven control applications.
Although they have been around since since the 70’s,
lack of data has made it impossible in practice to
showcase their real abilities until the last two decades
where massive automation and connectivity have made it
possible to generate a massive amount of data.
In this paper we show how it is possible to simulate an
mpc optimized control offline on an HVAC system
connected to a grid, a battery and a solar panel (the
system is introduced in the introduction) and train a deep
neural network (6 layers,  50  units each layer) in order to
achieve MPC without explicit control computation or
instruction, but rather exclusively the data generated by
the offline simulation.**
